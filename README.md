🚀 Zerodha Clone – Your Gateway to a Modern Trading Dashboard! 📈

I’m super excited to share my full-stack Zerodha-inspired stock trading platform, built with ❤️ using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and Chart.js. This project recreates the experience of a real-world trading app — complete with dynamic stock graphs, portfolio insights, market watchlists, and smooth UI transitions that make data not just informative, but actually enjoyable to explore.

The backend serves RESTful APIs built on Express.js, while the frontend is a fully responsive React app that visualizes data using stunning charts. It’s a clean, performance-focused experience that’s ideal for finance enthusiasts, traders, or anyone curious about fintech UI/UX.
